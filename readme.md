## Plot 

After the jellyFish Bloom of 2011 scientist began to create a species of fish that could be 
deployed into the seas to deal with the over population of certain species of fish. They created
a mutant Paranah which they beleived would help the ecosystems of the oceans but something
went wrong, as usually happens when dealing with dangerous science experiments, and this 
mutant was released into the ocean before testing could begin. As a result the population of 
the mutant paranah has increased exponentially and are killing sea life indiscriminantly.
The UN has created a taskforce armed with specialised air guns to exterminate the experiment
and unfortunatly you are among them. 

Your goal is to kill the Paranahs without killing the local sea life but don't worry they have
yet to develope a taste for human flesh. Good Luck!
